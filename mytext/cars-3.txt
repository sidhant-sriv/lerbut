Yes sir... you did
Yeah sure. You say

Well, I didn't want
you to be lonely
Well, thank you but
I'm kind of preparing for a race
I need a little quiet
Alright. You got it buddy
Hey every buddy, listen up.
My best friend Lightning McQueen
need quiet. Perfect quiet.
Okay, where was I
Racing. Real racing
Huh!! That ain't racing.
That wasn't even a sundae drive
That was one lap
racing is 500 of those
Everybody fighting to
move up lap after lap
Inside outside inches
apart never touching
Now that's racing
Well, I can't argue
with "The" Doc Hudson
How true. How true
Hey Lightning. Are you ready? Oh yeah
Lightning is ready
This one is for you Doc
CARS 3

Lightning McQueen.
Hey Cal, your blinkers are on.

Good comeback Cal
And into the pit goes Lightning McQueen
Bobby Swift and Cal Weathers
These three are fun to
watch. Aren't they Darrell?
You know Bob I can't tell they
have more fun on or off the track
You're geting the car wash too Cal..!!
No you're getting a car wash McQueen
Get them now

focus racing against Bobby and Cal

Lightning McQueen!!
Hey, Big Tex..
How's my favorite competitor?

dinoco team and replace him with you
You know I can hear you right?

McQueen and swift nose-to-nose
How's the view back there Boby
Well, you would better not bleep
Or, i'll blow right past you
The flap is out it's the final
stretch McQueen in the lead
Okay lets see what you got
Oh, it's Jackson Storm for the win
A huge upset. Even Lightning
or Bobby never saw him coming
It's one thing to start fast
But we haven't seen anyone cross
the line with that kind of speed and power
Since young Lightning McQueen first
arrived on the scene
Hey Bobby, who is that? That's...
Jackson Storm
yeah he's one of the rookies
Thank you, I appreciate it.
Thank you very much. Thank you
Hey, Jackson Storm right .great race today.
Wow, thank you Mr. McQueen
You have no idea what a pleasure
it is for me to finally beat you
Oh! thanks...
Wait hang on..Did you say meet or beat.
I think you heard me
What... McQueen over here .Storm,
can we get some pictures?
Yeah yeah, come on. Let's get a picture
You know what. You can
get a ton of pictures
Because the champ here has been a
role model of mine for years now
And I mean a lot of years
Right, I love this guy.
I think I touched a nerve
Welcome back to Chicks Picks
and Chick Hicks
I'm your host former and forever
Piston Cup champion Chick Hicks
This just in
Rookie Jackson Storm slaps the
proverbial door on Lightning McQueen
Oh, I couldn't have enjoyed it
more if i'd beaten McQueen myself
Oh, wait. I have
Now enough about me. Here
to tell you how it happened
Is professional number
cruncher miss Natalie Certain
It is pleasure to be here Chick and actually
i prefer the term statistical analyst
Right, so who is this mysterious newcomer
Jackson Storm and why is he so darn fast
It's no mystery if you
study the data Mr. Hicks.
Jackson's Storm is part of the
next generation of high-tech racers
Unlike the veterans of yesterday
Oh what, old-timers like this guy
ha ha...
Um..right
Storm achieves his top speeds
by exploiting the numbers
I refer of course
to racing data: Tire pressure, downforce
Weight distribution, aerodynamics
and nextgen's like Storm
are taking advantage
the racing world is changing
and for the better if it means my old
pal Lightning is down for the count
am I right certain
well, if i'm certain
of anything Chick
it's that this season
is about to get even more interesting
i'll tell you what Darrell
Jackson Storm has
certainly made an impact
we've got six more
next generation rookies in the field
with six veterans fired to clear
the way
good mornin champ.
How's our living legend today
still very much alive, thank you.
Now, I would appreciate if
I can't believe I get to race the Lightning
McQueen in his farewell season
what are you talking about
what..the green flag...
Good luck out there champ
you are gonna need it
one reason Storm and the
next gens are more efficient
their ability to hold the optimum
racing line every single lap
win number 3
for the rookie sansation
Storms in a class of
his own and a big reason for that
training on the newest
cutting-edge simulators
these Mackhines create a virtual
racing experience so real
racers
never even have to go outside
Storms ability to hold that line
is like nothing we've ever seen
four in a row..Are you kidding me
two percent lower drag
coefficient
oh! what a finish!!
5% increase in downforce
lucky number seven
1.2 % higher top speed.
Piston Cup winner Chick Hicks here with
the racer taking the circuit by Storm
Jackson Storm. Another easy win over old
katchow
or should I say the kaboos because
he's always in the back. Am I right?
No, no, no, Chick
McQueen is a crafty veteran champ
he's the elder statesman
of the sport you know
takes everything i
got to beat him
oh, you gotta be kidding me
what changes are you gonna make
to get McQueen back on top
will McQueen try new training method?
Is he prepare to retire?
guys let's not overreact..
It's just a slump..
we'll get him next week
okay that's enough
no comment
not even about
Cal Weathers retiring!!
Wait..what!!
Cal Weathers!!
He's hanging up his lightyears
no, no comment on that either
hey, Cal
hey....retirement!!
what's going on!!
You know, I asked my uncle once how i'd
know when it was time to stop
you know what he said
the youngsters will tell you
we had some good times together
i'm gonna miss that the most I think
yeah
more changes ahead Chick
every week we've seen veteran racers either
retire like cow Weathers tonight
or fired to make room for these younger
faster racers and it's not over yet
hello racing fan
welcome to the Los Angeles 500
final race of the
Piston Cup season.
I can do this
I raced for you guys
almost 10 years
Sorry Brick
my mind's made up
i'm giving your
number to someone new
hey! I had two win last year
old sport's changing..
Hey Bobby
do you know what's happening with Brick...
You.. wait! You're not Bobby
my name is Danny bro
hey champ, where would all your friends go
a final check of his tires as Storm
settles into the pole position
let's see in this season's
one of the great race
that's it buddy
40 laps to go and race leader Jackson Storm
is making his way on the pit road
with McQueen on his tail
a good stop
here could mean the difference between
victory and defeat
come on, come on, come on,
faster Guido. Come on!
I gotta go back out there
before he does
Guido... hurry up
what a pitstop by McQueen
man, he just got the lead
can he hold on it
hey McQueen, you alright?
Listen, don't you worry pal.
You had a good run
enjoy your retirement
Storm takes back the lead
unbelievable! McQueen is fading
McQueen is fading
fading fast.
No...no...no...no!
No!
Welcome back to Piston Cup talks
around-the-clock where we
do nothing but talk racing
let's get to it
starting of course
with Lightning McQueen
the season start
just two weeks away
there's still no
official announcement
but with number
95 coming off his worst year on record
don't shoot the messenger here folks
I think it's safe to assume that Lightning
McQueen's racing days are over
meanwhile Jackson Storm is looking
even faster than.
The number six
and the number 12 cars
are still fighting it out to the lead
but wait, here he comes
it's the fabulous Hudson
hornet knocking at their door
what's he got up his sleeve
today
and there it is with one incredible move
he has passed them
the hornet takes this decisive lead
he's left the pack behind
his crew chief Smokey is loving it..
It's unbelievable
oh no, this is trouble
the Hudson Hornet has
lost control
the Hudson Hornet has
lost control
what should have been a scene of jubilation
has turned tragic here today folks
we await news on the
Hudson Hornets condition
after such a devastating crash
we can only hope that this race today
wasn't his last
when I finally got put
together and went back
expecting a big welcome,
you know what they said?
You are history, moved right on to
the next rookie standing in line
there was a lot left in me.
I never got a chance to show
crash! the Hudson Hornet
is out for the season
hey, Stickers
hey, Sal
how are you feeling?
Yeah great
really really great
you have been thinking about Doc again?
Yeah
you know they told him
when he was done.
He didn't decide.
I don't want what happened to Doc
to happen to me
but that hasn't happened
no, but I can't go out on the track
and do the same old thing. It won't work
then change it up. Try something new.
I don't know Sally
don't fear failure
be afraid of not having the chance
you have the chance. Doc didn't
and you can either take it or you
can do what you've been doing
sitting in here for month
and by the way I love what
you've done with the place
I mean the monster movie Lightning
and the musky air freshener
and don't let anyone tell you
you're not working that primer
because wow, I have never found
you more attractive
and now that i've been in here
for a couple of minutes the stench
i'm getting kind of used to it
okay Sal, I get it. I get it.
I Miss you Lightning. We all do
try something new, huh
heyy, did it work Miss Sally
did you set him straight with your
lawyerly powers of persuasion
is he ready to start training?
Well, stinky Stickers
yes mater, I am.
I decide when i'm done.
I was hoping you'd say that
okay, but I got an idea
and i'm gonna need to talk
to Rusty and Dusty, all right
oh, i'll get them on the horn
yeah get them on the horn
oops, oh no, got a sneeze
dadgum, I lost it
hey, I will see you through.
I found it...
Hey, watch your steps
with a circular driveway
you boys need
to get your rusty tails down here
I created a drink in your honor
yeah, the Rusteze
medicated bumper balm
it goes down faster than
el mater following a bag off.
Rusty and Dusty, hey guys
hey there he is, good to see you Lightning
thanks guys
wow, you are all here
sorry buddy, did you
want this Call to be private?
No mater. This is perfect

I know now it's time for
me to make some changes
changes! what kind of changes
which feel to do is his change man
you're right Fillmore - really
which is why I have an
announcement to make
i've thought long and hard about it
done a lot of soul-searching and
considered all of the options
and I finally decided
you do want to keep racing
are you kidding! Of course
i want to keep racing
man for a second..., wait a minute...
I knew that the whole time
guys, i'm talking about making this my
best season yet

We sold Rusteze

something that we couldn't give you
if I'm right the time
was right for us too

this Sterling fellow
he's got every high-tech
thing you'll ever need

mud flap king of the eastern seaboard

been looking forward to this
thanks Mr...
Please, no Mr. just Sterling

whatever you do. Don't drive
like my brother
don't drive like my brother
so, you like it.
Oh, hey Mr. Sterling
my career on a wall.
Nice of you included Doc
well, of course. He
was your mentor
losing him left a giant
hole in the sport
yeah
jars of dirt..
"Sacred" dirt
each of those jars contains dirt from
all the old tracks the Doc raced on
Florida International
Thunder Hollow
just down the road and our very
own Fireball Beach right outside
hey, is that...
Bit of asphalt from Glen Allen
my first win
you really are a fan
I am and a fan of your future
you ready for it
definitely
first let's get you into
a more contemporary look.
Wow
it's electronic suit
with it we'll be able to track your
speed and your vital signs
does it have a phone.
Don't be crazy
race cars don't have bugs.
Wow... not bad ha
this is really impressive
this center has quickly become the most
coveted destination for young racers
training to make
our team someday
and it's where you'll train
until you leave for Florida
treadmills, wind tunnels, virtual reality
still working on that
and the best fitness regiment
anyone could possibly imagine
wait! wait!
Is that a simulator
oh yes.
Lightning McQueen i'd
like to introduce you
to the multi-million
dollar flagship
of interactive race simulation
the XDL 24 GTS Mark C
the XDL!
Jackson Storm wishes he had this model
it is just like been on a
real track to put your hours in
okay, let's hit the track most
come on, show me what you got.
Wow fast!
Who is the racer
no, no, no, no. She's not a racer
she's a trainer. Cruz Ramirez
the best trainer in the business
ready to meet it, greet it and defeat it
alright, now bring up those rpms
I like the attitude..
yeah..we call her a maestro
of motivation
you're driving a little
tense again Ronald

push through their own obstacles
tailor-made for each one
now, she's gonna work with you
let's go let's go
you guys gotta work through this stuff
so when your big chance
comes along you could take
hey, Cruz. Oh, hey Mr. Sterling
i'd like to introduce you
to Lightning McQueen
I hear you're the maestro
Mr. Sterling, did you say
Lightning McQueen was here?
Because I don't see him anywhere
uh, but he's right here
do you not see him
nope still don't see him
it's right in front of you
it is Lightning McQueen
he is obviously an imposter
he looks old and broken-down.
Hey
with flabby tires
I do not
use that! Woah
oh yeah, I see I can use that
energy from motivation right
it's all about motivation Mr.
McQueen
you can use anything negative as
fuel to push through to the positive
ah, pretty
positive ever since I was a rookie.
I am so excited that I get to train you
I grew up watching you on tv
ha, is that right
these young guys
are great and all
but I like a challenge
ha ha, not that much over.
In fact, I Call you
my senior project
we need to loosen
those ancient joints
first, the wheels and forward
and rest and forward and rest.
Join me. Rest
and rest
is all these resting necessary
we will work in you slowly
and reach for your ledge
reach for your ledge
now, wheels
to the fry
what is there, its your lines
now backwards
what is there
when do we go in the simulator
good morning Mr. McQueen
looking good
why
this will get oil to places
it hasn't been in a long time
is that a drip pan
just in case
how old you think I am?
Visualize yourself driving
fast down a steep hill
i'll be back in the field
visualize...! wait! Wait! Cruz
I feel what
I just like go on the simulator
how's it hanging
drip pan!
Okay, day three. Treadmill
i've set maximum
speed to conserve your energy
what I want you to do, is
visualize beating this guy
Storm! uh-huh that's right
get him .get him Mr. McQueen.
Get him
this is only going like five
miles an hour
we'll work up to the higher speed
right after you take your nap
nap!
Do I need a nap!
I am not taking a nap
how was your nap Mr. McQueen?
It was kind of
refreshing actually
oh... okay what do you ...Hey
you have been driving
on tires a long time
and you never stopped to get to know them
i'm sorry, what?
Tires are individuals
you should give each a name
name!
I will not be doing that
mine are named. Maria, Quarita, Ronaldo
and Debbie Richardson
what?
Long story
may I have my tires back so i
can go on the simulator please
name them!
Lefty, righty, backy
, backy junior. Okay
does this make you mad?
Yes it does
use that!
Emerge and kneel
emerge and kneel

Thank you Cruz. i'm done
Mr. McQueen, where are you going
to the future!
Okay, here we go. Here we go. How
do I do this? Come on baby
Mr. McQueen
Cruz, thank you for the old
man training as crazy as it was

The flag is out

flag... what do I do
go! go! Go!
Oh..., that is sensetive
you have hit the wall
it shouldn't be this hard, should it?
You have hit the wall
you are fighting the simulator
just race like you always do
you have hit the wall
there can't be this many walls
in a regular track
you have been passed by Jackson Storm
wait, Storm is in here
the motivation
Storm races at 2:07
pick it up Mr. McQueen!
I am trying
you have hit the wall
Mr. McQueen come down from there
we will work you up to this
I am fine Cruz. I can do it, okay
you have jumped a barrier
you have made two vechiles...
You have disabled an ambulance
you are on fire
danger! danger! You

Get these things off of me
you have crashed! You have crashed!
Are you alright?
You have crashed
I have crashed

i'm sorry, what!
I said floors all
washed up and clean
oh, right.
Thank you very much
good luck
hey, Lightning. Come on in. I got
something to show you
you ready
for what?
You are about to become the
biggest brand in racing
we are talking about saturation on
all continents for every demographic
movie deals, incommercials
, product endorsements
mud flaps
of course, you will
be rich beyond belief
do you think you're famous now?
I thought you'd be mad about the simulator
I mean this is all great Mr.
Sterling I guess but.
I don't know .i never really
thought of myself as a brand
oh, no. Do I? i'm a fan maybe
your most avid
I think of this as your legacy
it sounds like something that
happens after you're done racing
Mr. Sterling. What is this about?
Look Lightning!
i'm not gonna race you...
What!...what do you mean not racing
hold on! Hold on!
i'm not going to Florida.
Lightning!
You have no idea how
excited I was to get you here
because I knew I knew you'd be
back
this gonna be the comeback
story of the year but
your speed and performance
just aren't where they need to be
i'm sorry
we're talking about speed on a simulator.
Listen how crazy that sounds
look, i'm trying to help you
as your sponsor yes but also
as your friend
your racing days are coming
to an end
everytime you lose, you damage
yourself
damage the brand you mean.
Oh, lightening. Come on
you've done the work now
move on to the next phase
and reap the reward
the racing is the
reward not the stuff.
I don't want to cash in. I want to feel
the rush of moving 200 miles an hour
inches from the other guys
pushing myself faster
than I thought I could go
that's the reward Mr. Sterling.
Oh, lightening. Come on.
Look, I can do this. I can, I promise.
i'll train like I did with Doc
i'll get my tires dirty on every
turn track from here in the Florida
I can start right there on fireball
beach where all the old greats used to race
get your tires dirty
that's how you're gonna
get faster than Storm
yes! exactly!
I mean sacred dirt, right
Mr. sterlin if you care about
my legacy, the one that Doc started
you'll let me do this. I
promise you I will win.
I don't know
what you're asking it's to risky
come on, you like it .i can tell
it's got that little comeback story
of the year feel to it, doesn't it?
One race
if you don't win at
Florida, you'll retire
look... if I don't win also
i will hold the mud flaps you got
but if I do win, I decide
when i'm done
deal
deal.
Thank you Mr. Sterling.
You won't be sorry
just one thing and this is only because
i don't like taking chances
you're taking someone with you
you talked him into it
way to go Mr. McQueen
Cruz! you could talk a snowmobile
into an air conditioner
you're going with me
with that thing
yeah, you still need my help
you're brittle like a fossil.
I don't need a trainer out here Cruz
you're old
what if you have fallen on
this beach and can't get up
well, life's a beach and
then you drive
ha ha McQueen..
Thank you
this is beautiful
I can see why Mr. Sterling said you
wanted to train out here
as soon as this thing's
booted up, we'll get
you on the treadmill and
i'll track your speed
what! no! The whole idea
is getting my tires dirty.
Real racing not driving on that
thing when i've got the sand
and the whole earth
oh, okay. Luigi, let's do this
welcome a racer
to fireball beach
historiCal for
today's great test of speed
our finish line will be the
abandoned appear in the distance
all right, quicker than quick
faster than fast, I am speed
that is great self-motivation
did you come up with
that? Yeah I did
on your mark, get set! Go!
Here you go, felt good
hey, what was my speed
i don't know
I can only track you on the treadmill
no treadmills.
Oh, what about Hamilton
Hamilton here
who's Hamilton
my electronic personal
assistant you know like on your phone

Race cars don't have phones
Cruz
Hamilton! track Mr. McQueen's speed

tracking
i'll stay as close as I can
your suit will transmit
your speeds to Hamilton
fine whatever
quicker than quick, faster than fast
i am speed, come on Luigi. On your mark
get set and go
46 mile per hour
53 miles.. Out of range

134 miles
out of range. Out of range
out of range
now, what!
I didn't wanna hit a crab
you gotta be kidding me

allright, one last chance
we will try this before get started
now, your are gonna pick on
slow to let your tires grab
yes! and pick a straight line
on hard sands so you don't spin out
and all the crabbies have gone night-night
Mr. McQueen
all right, let's go again
150 miles per hour
175 miles per hour
196 miles per hour
right, finally you made it
congratulations!, how did I do?
You topped out at 198

Whipple filter
it's Lightning McQueen
got my tires dirty at
thunder hollow
the fans here in thunder hollow
still buzzing over
tonight's unexpected
appearance of Lightning McQueen
he has always been my favorite
my garage is covered from head
to toe with 95 posters
so.
Trophies are kind of nice
don't you think.
I mean I know you got like a
billion of them so you would know.
I still can't believe I won
it's pretty shiny, I have
never seen one up close
looks like they spent a lot of money on it
i mean I think it's real nut up
stop! just stop! Okay, Cruz
you don't even know
you don't even have one clue.
Hey!I was just trying to...
Do you know
what happens if I lose this race
every mile of this trip was to get
me faster than Jackson Storm
faster.
I start off getting
nowhere for a week on a simulator
I lose a whole day with
you on fireball beach
and then I waste tonight and then
a crosshairs for Miss Fritter
i'm stuck in the same speed i
was a month ago
I can't get any faster because i'm too
busy taking care of my trainer
this is my last chance Cruz
last final finito. If i
lose, I never get to do this again
if you were a racer you'd
know what i'm talking about but you're not
so you don't.
Mack! pull over!
Now! now!
Okay okay pulling over
pulling over
ask me if I dreamed of being a trainer
Mr. McQueen go ahead
ask me if I got up in the dark to
run laps before school every day
ask me if I saved every penny to buy a
ticket to the races when they came to town
ask me if I did that so
that I could be a trainer someday ask me
No!
I wanted to become a racer forever
because of you.
I used to watch you on TV
flying in the air
you seemed so
fearless
dream small Cruz
that's what my
family used to say
dream small or not at all
they were just trying to protect me
but I was the fastest kid in town and i
was gonna prove them wrong
what happened
when I got to my first race.
I figured it out what
what
that I didn't belong
the other racers
look nothing like me
they were bigger
and stronger and so confident
and when they started their engines
that was it.
I knew i'd never be a racer.
I just left
it was my one shot
and I didn't take it
yeah so uh
i'm gonna head back to
the training center
I think we both know
it's for the best
but can I ask you something
what was it like for you
when you showed up to your first race
how did you know you could do it.
I don't know, I just never
thought I couldn't
it was shiny with that felt like
good luck Mr. McQueen
Cruz
Cruz, wait.
Champion for the ages
, Chick Hicks here
coming to you live from
Chick Hicks studios
where i'm joined once again by
next-gen racing expert, Natalie Certain
thanks Chick, Piston Cup
champion Jackson Storm
set a new record today when he pulled
off the fastest lap ever recorded
an unprecedented 213
miles an hour
so what do you think Certain
Stormy boy gonna start the
season with another win
highly likely Chick
based on his recent run times and
forecasted track temperatures on race day
Storms chances of winning are
95.2 %
that low huh
oh and in case you Missed it
talk of the track tonight is
Lightning McQueen finding
yet another way to
embarrass himself
at a demolition derby whoa
wow
almost makes me feel sorry
for the guy not really
here's what his new sponsor had to say
everyone relax, the 95 is gonna race
Lightnings just
taking a somewhat
unconventional approach
to this race
it's one of the things his fans love
about him
huh yeah right
talk about humiliating
ahow, I won't even bother to
show up in Florida
that could be for the best Chick
even if he does race. McQueen's
probability of winning is 1.2 percent.
Wow
numbers never lie.
i'm willing to predict tonight
that Lightning McQueen's
racing career will be over within the week
it might even be over now
I mean I knew his career
was stuck in the...
First you find a clamp from a rusty vamp
bump bump
quicker than a dart
make it in the park bump bump

What?
I don't know I got nothing
I guess I ain't Doc when it comes to that.
I would give anything to talk
to him right now
yeap there was nobody smarter
than old Doc
well except for maybe
whoever taught him
wait, what?
I mean everybody was
taught by somebody right
take my cousin Dort
he taught me
how to sing and whistled at the same time
he was very musical that way
Smokey
Mater! you're brilliant!
uh well..It's all about shape of
your teeth
I gotta go to Thomasville.
Oh well good you know me buddy
i'm always happy to help

I resign as your trainer

i'm looking for someone named Smokey
hoping he can help me

okay but maybe this will
change your mind, hit it
first i'm gonna loosen
up these ancient joints

Nope. Okay
so tell me this?
How do you know if it's Smokey
wait, Mack pull over
Thomasville speedway
home of 51 fabulous Hudson Hornet
good to see you Doc
hey isn't that your
old crew chief?
hey Cruz, do you want to check out the
home track of the greatest racer ever
aren't we supposed to
be looking for Smokey
oh that's right he is dead
we don't know that
are you sure you have time for this?
for this I do
Piston Cup
Smokey's garage.
Wow, if this track could talk
Cruz, what do you say
let's take a lap.
Wow
yes, you nailed it
way easy without the school bus of death
trying to kill us
yeah, no kidding.
I've started to think
i might never meet you
Smokey!
He is alive I know why you're here
you're thirsty
i'll tell you what
these folks are gonna get a kick out of
meeting Huds boy
who's Hud? Oh, Doc Hudson right
hey
act civilized, we got company.
Would you look at that?
what?
three of the biggest racing legends ever
Jr. Midnight Moon, River Scott ,
Louise Stormer Nash,she had 38 wins
well as I live and breathe if it
ain't Lightning McQueen
Miss Nash
it's a pleasure to meet you
you had a tough year haven't you?
oh uh....
shouldn't you be running practice laps
in Florida by now
yeah sure bu...
you're here to steal our secrets
looking for you lost mojo.
Wow, you don't mince words
around here do you
truth is always quicker, kid.
But she used to have serious eyes for Hud
oh really
even if I did it wouldn't have mattered
Hud didn't like fast women
and that left me out
no Lou wasn't just fast
she was fearless
the second I saw my first race I just
knew I had to get in there
of course the fellas in charge
didn't like the idea
of a lady racer showing them up
so they wouldn't let me
have a number
what did you do?
i stole one..
what!!
I still short to take no for an answer,
right River?
if we waited for an invitation
we might have never raced
and once we got on the track
we didn't want to leave and
that's how Doc felt too
you should have seen him when he first came
to town
shiny blue paint
not just a Hudson Hornet
he was already Calling himself
The Fabulous Hudson Hornet
did we ever ride him on that
not for long
Hud was the fastest race of this side
of the Mississippi, until he wasn't
what!!
Everything changed when
the rookie showed up
took Hud all at no time to work his way
through the best racers in both Carolina
passed River, passed Lou, even Junior
but there was still the rookie to deal with
he tried slamming
him into the wall
but Hud never touched any wall
unless he wanted to
that rookie never saw anything
like that before
Doc did that!!
Oh are you kidding
couldn't wipe the smile off his face
for a week after that.
I wish I could have seen him like that
like what
so happy
you didn't come all
this way for a quart of oil, did you?
I need your help Smokey
yeah, what kind of help
that's just it, i'm not sure
all I know is if I lose in Florida
it's it's over for me
what happened to Doc will happen to me
what did happen to him
no, racing was the best part of his life
and when it ended he
we both know he was never the same
after that
is that what you think
come on
i want to show you something
you got the first part right
the crash broke Hud's body and the
no more racing broke his heart
he cut himself off,
disappeared to radiator springs
son-of-a-gun
didn't talk to me for 50 years
but then one day
the letters started coming
and every last one of them
was about you
yeah, Hud loved racing
but coaching you...
I had never seen the old grump so happy.
racing wasn't the best part of Hud's life
you were
ready to go out for little carbon air, boy
yes I am
give it too much travel
you in the tulip
hey, Lightning you might
want to take notes on this one
you got a lot of stuff, kid
Hud saw something in you
that you don't even see in yourself
are you ready to go find it
yes sir
all right, all right
lesson one: You're old accept it
i told him that
he is probably losing his hearing
he said you're old, I heard him
you'll never be as fast as Storm but
you can be smarter than him
okay what do I do?
you said you were in a demolition derby..
yeah it was terrible
are you sure?
'Cause there's not a scratch on you
funny what a racer can do when he's
not overthinking things
shannon spokes here at
Florida international
Jackson Storm clocked
214 miles per hour today
you want to beat the Storm
you need someone to stand in for
like a sparring partner
i'm not so sure I not a racer,
just a trainer
just a trainer
go ahead and gun it
yeah, with no muffler
you even sound like Storm
oh you're going down McQueen
get that arthritis rail
keister onto the tracks, so I can
put you into the old folks
home against your will
how is that
that will work, work for me ,
i'm good .yeah that will do
what ever she says...
You didn't show up in Florida
for qualifying
so you'll be starting dead last
i'll give you three
laps to catch her
go through the entire field
in three laps!!
You wanna beat Storm or not?
Yes of course I do
well, then go!!
Come on, kid
all right, looks like
we got some work to do
look alive..reflexes are
the first thing to go
why are we in a field
sneak through that window
what is that mean? I don't know!
Go.
Not cool man, not cool
let's roll it back
do you even want to be out here
only two days left, yet
we gotta work harder
what the hell, who is that?
I put McQueen in there
to give you some real competition.
Hud was a master of letting
the other cars do the work for him
he used to say, playing to him is like
you were two june bugs on a summer night
he stole that form me
drafting, i've never had to do that
yeah that's when you were fast
now you're slow and old and
rickety and...
Okay, okay, I get it
the new you has to look for
opportunities you never knew were there
sneak through the window
sneak through the window what?
When a window opens take it
yes!
I made it
let's go, let's move
reflexes!
Alright Guido, turn up the heat
okay
alright, look who finally showed up
this where we cut our racing teeth
in the woods
let's just say the moon
was always shining on us
if the moon didn't shine we
didn't have to... oh, nevermind
we ran moonshine dummy oh!
By the way, no lights
instinct only
McQueen still not here, didn't he pull
this when he was a rookie
this is my grandfather told me
all right, we got time for one last race.
Hurry this along boss
we gotta get you to Florida
go!!
Maybe it's best that he doesn't show up
you know after how last season ended
let me put it this way
i'm not losing any sleep wondering
where Lightning McQueen is!
Come on! Come on!
There you go!
McQueen is fading! McQueen is fading!
Fading fast!!
Did you see that?
That was incredible
uh, sorry. I didn't mean to
hey boss, it's time to hit the road
yeah, I wanna thank everyone for
the training
we better get going to Florida

broadcasting partner Darrell Cartrip

Whipple Filter

Yeah, to the future.
Hey... just focus on what
you're here to do kid
thanks Smokey.
Now, go make Hud proud. You got it
Lightning McQueen is making steady progress
in the early parts of this race
it won't be enough to catch Storm
considered he started dead last
I don't think he's doing
half bad out there
not too shabby
keep this up you'll finish in the top ten
top ten is not going to cut it Smokey
I got to go all the way
so dig in remember your training
find Storm and chase him down.
Oh tell him he has three
laps to catch me
Cruz says you've got
three laps to catch her
okay. tell her thanks
Cruz, what are you doing here?
Oh Mr. Sterling I was just...
I would like you to head back
to the training center right away,
oh! but why? I need you to get Kurt up to
speed for the race next weekend

I want to stay and watch
that's not gonna happen Cruz
now go
but Mr. McQueen still has a chance
just go do your job

If you were racer, you'd know
what i'm talking about but you're not

I wanted to become a racer forever
because of you!
It was my one shot and I didn't take it

because your gps was broken
don't listen to him Cruz
you look good
it's important to look the part that
you can't have everyone thinking that
you don't deserve to be here
just trying to get in your head
they don't need to know
what you and I already do
that you can play dress-up all you
want but you'll never be one of us
Cruz, did you see what happened there
yeah, he's in he's in my head
no no
listen to me! You got
into his head don't you understand
he would never have done
that if you didn't scare him

you are a racer! Use that!
How far back is she now?

You are angry! I am not angry!
You can use that anger to push through
i said i'm not angry.
I don't think so
Cruz, get out of there!
You don't belong on this track
yes, I don't.
I don't believe it!
It's Cruz Ramirez for the win

It is? You got me! Very funny
go ahead...Get them some smoke
you'll get used to that
come on, move it! Move!
Cruz, I knew you
had something and now look at you
a winner. I could use you
as a racer on our team .we...
Sorry Mr. Sterling, I would
never race for you. I quit
well then race for me
Tex, Miss Cruz I would be tickled pink
to have you race for team dinoco
as you know we have a long history
of great racers
except for the Cal
oh guys, I am still right here
team dinoco Cruz! Hire her
i don't care
Lightning now that you're retired, i
need your first thing monday morning
for a photo shoot
yeah all right Mr. Sterling
oh, hang on now
what! why is my name up there!
You've started the race

If Lightning McQueen wins, he decides
when he's done racing that was the deal

Great number
it was McQueen's idea
he felt Hud would've wanted you to have it
I love it oh it's perfect it's very
old-school

Fabulous McQueen
to Doc Hudson
you are trying something new

Wow subtle! I figured if i'm gonna be
your crew chief i'd better do it in style
what's Mr. Sterling gonna say
i'm actually more worried about what Tex is
gonna say considering he bought Rusteze
thanks Tex!
I made that Sterling fella
a Texas-sized offer

Oh, I hope you got your fluffy cloud
I hope you got your drip pan!
