If a student has CGPA less than 4.0, what all to advise the students?


 If a student has a CGPA less than 4.0, they will be advised to register for a maximum of 20 credits in subsequent semesters until their CGPA crosses 4.0. They also have the option to re-register for courses in which they obtained an 'F' or 'N' grade. However, if they fail to improve their academic performance, their studentship with the University may be cancelled. The student may also choose to audit a course not listed in their programme curriculum without undergoing the rigors of getting a good grade. Students with CGPA 9.0 and above and no current backlog courses are exempted from minimum attendance requirements. If a student fails to register the minimum number of courses in any semester, their studentship with the University may be cancelled. The student has the option to use options like registering for failed 'Honours' courses again or grade improvement to improve grades obtained in 'Honours' courses and raise the CGPA to the required level if they complete a project work substantially advanced than expected, it may be referred to a high-profile Committee for the 'Honours' award. If a student fails to meet the minimum grade requirement, they will be awarded an 'E' grade and declared as pass. Under such circumstances, the maximum of the grade band shall not exceed 100%.
If a student had a plan to Semester Abroad Program, what all advise to give students?


 If a student is planning to participate in VIT University's Semester Abroad Program, here are some advices:

1. During the first semester of their program, students should register for courses according to the guidance received from their HoD/Program Chair during orientation. This may include taking bridge courses if needed.
2. For Semester Abroad, students should attend the roadshow organized by the Office of International Relations and choose universities and courses carefully. They may be offered more courses than usual and should register for those that meet their requirements or are of interest to them.
3. Students must ensure they register for the minimum number of courses each semester to maintain their enrollment with the University.
4. If a student fails to clear a course, they may have the opportunity to take another course instead in subsequent semesters and pay re-registration charges. However, if they receive an 'F' grade in a UE (University Elective) course, they may be required to retake that specific course.
5. Some courses may have prerequisites that must be completed before registration. Students should ensure they have met all prerequisites at the time of course registration or make arrangements to do so if necessary.
6. Students who miss the CAT (Computer-Based Test) for any reason can take a supplementary CAT, subject to approval by the School Dean.
Medical policy advises to students


 The medical policy advises students who are absent from classes due to prolonged illness or other valid reasons beyond 25% of the semester, to request for a 'Break of Study' and provide a proper medical certificate authenticated by the Chief Medical Officer. In case of absence during a Final Adjudication Theory/Student Project examination due to hospitalization or death of a family member, students may apply to the Vice Chancellor with supporting documents. For temporary breaks in study due to valid reasons such as accident or prolonged ill health, students may be recommended by their programme School and approved by the Dean, Academics. No formal approval from the Academic Council is required for the cancellation of such studentships. Additionally, students and faculty members involved in research are requested not to change settings in Turnitin software or the documents given, and must follow research integrity as per VIT policy. Applications for waivers related to medical certificates must be submitted within 14 days after completion of the examination. The JCR-Clarivate report quartile rankings have been used as an indicator to finalize the policy guidelines.
How to give attendance during sectional holidays 


 To give attendance during sectional holidays as indicated in the context, a student is required to submit a request to their HoD or Program Chair through the Proctor for consideration. These sectional holidays are declared as instructional days, and students who avail of them need to submit an attendance request despite being considered absences. However, medical, personnel, casual, official leave for organizing events or any other valid reason is included in the 25% absence limit, beyond which a student may be advised to request a 'Break of Study' on medical grounds. It's important to note that for summer/intersession semesters, students are required to maintain the minimum 75% attendance despite no exemptions being applicable during these periods.
What are the minimum and maximum credits to be registered 


 The minimum number of credits to be registered in a semester is 16, and the maximum number is 27, except for the last registration of a program where a student may register less than 16 credits to meet the minimum credit requirements. For summer/intersession/weekend semesters, the number of credits to be registered ranges from 6 to 8 or 2 courses, whichever is less, but in special cases, a student may be permitted to register a maximum of 12 credits with the approval of the Proctor and School Dean.

2. Curriculum Planning: Familiarize yourself with the available courses under various departments and plan your semester-wise course selection based on program requirements, course prerequisites, and personal interests.

How to do grade improvement


 To do grade improvement, you need to register for the same course again during a subsequent Course Registration process. However, this is only allowed in regular Fall semester or Regular Winter semester, and you will have to pay fees for the grade improvement. Only one grade improvement is allowed per semester for all students except final year students, who can apply for more than one. You can find the payment link against the course in your timetable after the invoice generation, and you need to pay within three days of invoice generation or generate a new invoice if you miss the deadline.

Please brief on the MIT curriculum 


 The MIT curriculum consists of courses grouped into University Core (UC), Program Core (PC), Program Elective (PE), and University Elective (UE) categories. Courses under University Core are mandatory for all similar degree programs and offer a project-based learning approach, interdisdisciplinary opportunities, flexibility for slow learners, optional summer/intersession semesters, research experience, value addition with double major or honors, and branch change options for high performers. Both the Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) program and the Applied Learning (CAL) curriculum follow this structure to provide students with multidisciplinary exposure and opportunities to enhance communication, soft skills, management, and technical skills. The curriculum includes course objectives, expected outcomes, modules, duration, suggested textbooks, and syllabus approval dates.

For PhD programs admitted till 2018, students are required to complete four courses with a minimum of 12 credits or refer to the VTOP for options. Integrated PhD students must complete eight courses with a minimum of 25 credits. PG level courses should not have been studied by scholars in their previous PG program. The curriculum is subject to change and students must follow the prescribed curriculum for their academic year, unless stated otherwise by the Academic Council. Enrolment and registration for Research Methodology and Research and Publication Ethics can be done prior to approval from the Academic Council, but scholars must pay online for registered courses before the deadline.
